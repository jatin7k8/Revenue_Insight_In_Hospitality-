## üìà **Key Business Metrics**

### 1. **Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR)**
   **Formula**:
   \[
   RevPAR = \frac{\text{Total Revenue}}{\text{Total Rooms Available to Sell}}
   \]

### 2. **Occupancy Percentage (%)**

### 3. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**

### 4. **Sellable Room Nights (SRN)**
   - **Daily Basis**: SRN = Total Rooms √ó Days.
   - **Adjusted Metric (DSRN)**: Accounts for unavailable rooms due to maintenance or other reasons.

### 5. **Utilized Room Nights (URN)**
   Includes utilized bookings and paid no-shows.
